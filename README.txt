Hi! Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and space bar to swap the blocks in the cursor. If the blocks reach the top of the screen, you lose.

UPCOMING FEATURES:
	Holding a button to increase the rise speed


The naming convention is that "rates" are for things that need to happen once every few seconds; "speeds" are for things that need to happen several times per second
	
For best animation results, make sure combo_fade_rate * cell_drop_speed is less than your overall framerate
